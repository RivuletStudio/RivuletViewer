  "readme": "## n3d-threejs\nThis packages the [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/three.js) library as a [node.js module](http://nodejs.org/api/modules.html).\n\nNote: This is only the minified core ```THREE``` object packaged for easy deployment (e.g. _it can be required and bundled using [browserify](https://www.npmjs.org/package/browserify) on the server before being transmitted in a single http-response to the client_) and **does not include all of the additional utility files which come with a full [Three.js](https://github.com/mrdoob/Three.js) installation** (i.e. examples, post-processing/shaders, Controllers & other additional utilities) which in total amounts to around a 100Mb dependency. You can of course include any supplemental code by using ```<script src=\"\">``` tags in an index.html file as needed, although that would be sub-optimal because you are adding to the download overhead when initially loading the page with additional http requests.\n\n\n### Installation\n```shell\nnpm install n3d-threejs\n```\n\nOR\n\n```shell\ncd <app-folder>/node_modules\ngit clone git@github.com:joates/n3d-threejs.git\n```\n\n\n### Example\n```js\nvar THREE = require('n3d-threejs')\n\nvar width = window.innerWidth\nvar height = window.innerHeight\nvar scene, camera, renderer, cube\n\nfunction init(){\n  scene = new THREE.Scene()\n  camera = new THREE.PerspectiveCamera(45, width/height, 0.1, 10000)\n\n  renderer = new THREE.WebGLRenderer()\n  renderer.setSize(width, height)\n  document.body.appendChild(renderer.domElement)\n\n  var geometry = new THREE.BoxGeometry(1, 1, 1)\n  var material = new THREE.MeshBasicMaterial({color: 0x00ff00})\n  cube = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, material)\n  scene.add(cube)\n\n  camera.position.z = 5\n}\n\nfunction animate(){\n  requestAnimationFrame(animate)\n  update()\n  render()\n}\n\nfunction update(){\n  cube.rotation.x += 0.1\n  cube.rotation.y += 0.1\n}\n\nfunction render(){\n  renderer.render(scene, camera)\n}\n\ninit()\nanimate()\n```\n\n\n## License\nThe MIT License\n\nCopyright &copy; 2010-2015 three.js authors\n\nPermission is hereby granted, free of charge, to any person obtaining a copy\nof this software and associated documentation files (the \"Software\"), to deal\nin the Software without restriction, including without limitation the rights\nto use, copy, modify, merge, publish, distribute, sublicense, and/or sell\ncopies of the Software, and to permit persons to whom the Software is\nfurnished to do so, subject to the following conditions:\n\nThe above copyright notice and this permission notice shall be included in\nall copies or substantial portions of the Software.\n\nTHE SOFTWARE IS PROVIDED \"AS IS\", WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR\nIMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO THE WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY,\nFITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE AND NONINFRINGEMENT.
